<!-- Some general rules for file paths:

    -To link to a target file in the same directory as the invoking HTML file, just use the filename, e.g. my-image.jpg.
    
    -To reference a file in a subdirectory, write the directory name in front of the path, plus a forward slash, e.g. subdirectory/my-image.jpg.
    
    -To link to a target file in the directory above the invoking HTML file, write two dots. So for example, if index.html was inside a subfolder of test-site and my-image.jpg was inside test-site, you could reference my-image.jpg from index.html using ../my-image.jpg.
    
    -You can combine these as much as you like, for example ../subdirectory/another-subdirectory/my-image.jpg.-->
